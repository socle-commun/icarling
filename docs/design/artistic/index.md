# ðŸŽ¨ Icarling â€“ Artistic Design Document

## Art Style

- Whimsical, storybook aesthetic
- Soft, painted textures with warm tones
- High emphasis on silhouettes and readable animation

## Palette

- **Sky blues**, **sun golds**, **cloud whites**, **wax ivory**, **bronze ruins**
- Gentle color shifts to indicate emotional tone or danger

## Characters

- Freckled sun-child with tousled golden hair
- Wears a tunic patched from feathers and cloth
- Wax wings that glow and drip
- Goggles on forehead

### Enemies (WIP)

- Wax spirits
- Wind wisps
- Greedy sun moths

## Environments

- Floating Sky Ruins: broken columns, temples in the clouds
- Heat Zones: shimmering sun shafts that drain wax
- Shade Zones: caves or shadowed ruins that replenish wax
- Wind Currents: animated layers that lift or push

## UI & HUD

- Wax Meter (dripping bar)
- Feather Count (collectibles)
- Subtle parchment-style dialog boxes

## Animation & FX

- Gliding: wing flutters and wax drip particles
- Landing: soft cloud puff
- Meltdown: wings collapse and splash
- Background parallax clouds

## Sound

- Original ambient soundtrack with mythic tones
- Dynamic music reacting to wax meter or altitude
