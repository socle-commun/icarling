## 📐 DESIGN DOCUMENTATION

### Game Concept

A lighthearted platformer where players control **Icarling**, a mischievous child with wax wings trying to reach the mythical sun gate above the skies. The game mixes **platforming precision** with a **melting wing mechanic** that creates urgency and rhythm.

### Inspirations

- **Mythology**: Icarus, sun quests, ancient ruins
- **Games**: Celeste, Ori and the Blind Forest, Fez
- **Tone**: Whimsical, adventurous, poetic

### Main Character

**Icarling**

- **Visuals**: Freckled cheeks, wax-dripping wings, patchwork clothes, flying goggles
- **Abilities**: Jump, glide (limited time), wax boost (burst jump)
- **Weakness**: Wings melt if you glide too long without landing

### World Design

- **Floating Sky Ruins**: Platforms drift, tilt, or react to wind
- **Sun Temples**: Puzzle areas tied to mythic relics
- **Melting Trials**: Time-based levels that test wax endurance

### Core Mechanics

- **Jump & Glide**: Traditional 2D controls with added verticality
- **Wax Meter**: Drains during gliding, recharges on ground or near shade
- **Wind Currents**: Can help or hinder movement

### Visual Style

- Hand-painted art
- Warm, saturated colors
- Emphasis on vertical movement and depth

### Logo

- "ICARLING" with sunburst and wing motifs
- Serif lettering with slight drips or curves to evoke wax

### Sound

- Original ambient soundtrack with mythic tones
- Dynamic music reacting to wax meter or altitude

More to come in the next phase (level design, enemy ideas, UI mockups).
